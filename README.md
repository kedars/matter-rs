## Build

Building the library:
```
$ cd matter
$ cargo build
```

Building the example:
```
$ cd matter
$ RUST_LOG="matter" cargo run --example onoff_light
```

With the chip-tool (the current tool for testing Matter) use the Ethernet commissioning mechanism:
```
$ chip-tool pairing ethernet 12344321 123456 0 <IP-Address> 5540
```

Interact with the device
```
# Read server-list
$ chip-tool descriptor read server-list 12344321 0

# Read On/Off status
$ chip-tool onoff read on-off 12344321 1

# Toggle On/Off by invoking the command
$ chip-tool onoff on 12344321 1
```

## Functionality
- Secure Channel:
  - PASE
  - CASE
- Interactions:
  - Invoke Command(s), Read Attribute(s), Write Attribute(s)
- Commissioning:
  - over Ethernet
  - Network Commissioning Cluster
  - General Commissioning Cluster
  - Operational Certificates Cluster
- Some [TODO](TODO.md) are captured here

## Notes

The matter-rs project is a work-in-progress and does NOT yet fully implement Matter.
